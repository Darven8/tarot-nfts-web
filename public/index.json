My name is Darven Norris, and I am thrilled to share with you the story of my journey in creating a Tarot NFT AI Collection.\nTo be honest, the creation of this collection wasn’t part of my grand master plan. Tarot, NFTs, and AI generated art all recently came into my life serendipitously, and the result is this unique and mesmerizing collection.\nAs a lifelong fan of the arts and a passionate collector of rare and unique items, I’ve always been drawn to the fascinating world of Tarot cards. The intricate designs, vivid colors, and rich symbolism of these mystical cards have captivated me since I was a child.\nBut it wasn’t until I stumbled upon the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that I realized the true potential of Tarot cards as a digital art form. And once I discovered the incredible possibilities of AI, there was no turning back.\nWith this newfound inspiration in mind, I embarked on a mission to create the most unique and awe-inspiring Tarot NFT AI Collection that the world has ever seen. It wasn’t easy, as I had to learn everything along the way. But through hard work and determination, I figured it out.\nUsing the latest in AI technology, I brought to life 18,352 one-of-a-kind Tarot card designs, based on the 22 Major Arana Tarot cards, each with its own unique combination of colors, patterns, and symbolism.\nI poured my heart and soul into this collection, striving to capture the essence of each card’s meaning and symbolism through my art. My hope is that these Tarot NFTs will not only be a beautiful addition to any collection, but also a source of inspiration and enlightenment for all who own them.\nThank you for taking the time to learn about my journey in creating this Tarot NFT AI Collection. I can’t wait for you to explore and discover the wonder and beauty of these unique and mesmerizing Tarot NFTs for yourself!\n","date":1682553600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682553600,"objectID":"c72573b9013d6c0043d1b9f70b7c1ab2","permalink":"https://tarotnfts.art/post/about-me/","publishdate":"2023-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/about-me/","section":"post","summary":"The Inspiration Behind TarotNFTs.Art AI Collection.","tags":null,"title":"About Me","type":"post"},{"authors":["Darven Norris","arcana mind","collections"],"categories":null,"content":"About The Collection Introducing Arcana Mind: the groundbreaking new tarot NFT collection powered by artificial intelligence.\nWith +18,000 unique tarot NFTs to choose from, Arcana Mind is the largest and most comprehensive tarot NFT collection ever created.
